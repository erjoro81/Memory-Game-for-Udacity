## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

How to play: Click a tile and remember the image. Click on a second tile and if the images match, they will both stay visible. If not, they will flip back down. Try
to get as many matches using the fewest moves possible.

3 stars = 8 moves or less
2 stars = 9 to 16 moves
1 star = more the 16 moves
